Materials for video PE #63 entitled "A More Detailed Analysis of the Closed-Loop Response of DC-DC Converters"

Available at: https://youtu.be/iMp4uD411U0

In this video we show how to analyze the closed-loop response of a dc-dc converter considering the effect of the frequency response of the operational amplifier used to implement the compensator. The loop gain of the closed-loop converter is calculated and plotted for both an ideal compensator and a real compensator. A particular example for a PI compensator used in a closed-loop buck converter is shown. Qspice simulations are presented to illustrate the different ideas
